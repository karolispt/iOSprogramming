## Alamofire
        Alamofire and URLSession both help you to make network requests in Swift. The URLSession API is part of the foundation framework, whereas Alamofire needs to be added as an external dependency. (ANTOINE VAN DER LEE, 2019)

        I used Alamofire framework, which is very popular iOS framework, to make my life simplier when implementing network requests with the APIs given in the Exam, and the code itself is more readable when using Alamofire in my own opinion. Also because of the recommendation of my teacher in this Exam.
        
        The other way around one could write networking code in is URLSession API.
